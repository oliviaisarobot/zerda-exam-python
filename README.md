## 6. Question time! (~30 mins) [6p]

### Explain the algorithm seen in `third.py`. Use a flowchart, structogram or pseudo code. [2p]
#### Your answer:

The third exercise is using a for loop. What it does is, it goes through the letters of the string starting with the first letter. Then it checks if the current letter of the string matches the letter given as a parameter. If it does, it adds one to the counter and the for loop continues, if it doesn't, the for loop continues. The for loop will keep running until it reaches the last letter in the string.
